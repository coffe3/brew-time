            <h1>Founder</h1>
            <p>
              Hi there! I'm EDITHv12, the founder 
           of Brew Time. My love affair with coffee 
           began years ago, sparked by the irresistible 
           aroma of freshly brewed beans. Fuelled by a 
           passion for sharing great coffee with others, 
           I set out on a mission to create a space where 
           every cup tells a story. At Brew Time, I pour my 
           heart and soul into every aspect of the coffee 
           experience, from sourcing the finest beans to 
           crafting the perfect brew. Join me on this 
           journey as we explore the wonderful world of 
           coffee together!
